## FAQs

<b>1. What type of content can I upload to SummarAIze? </b><br>
  You can upload any lengthy video that you wish to shorten, as long as there is a transcript of the video available.
  
<b>2. What kind of keywords do I need to upload?</b><br>
  You can upload the words that you wish to shorten the video around. The sentences with the words that you enter will be chosen from the video and be pieced together to create the summarized version.
  
<b>3. What can I do if I forgot my password?</b></br>
  We apologize for the inconvinience. At the time, we have not implemented the functionality to retrieve passwords. We would suggest to make a new account with a different email ID.
  
<b>4. Do I need to be a student to utilize SummarAIze?</b><br>
  Absolutely not! SummarAIze can be used by anyone as long as they have a video and its transcript. The best case scenario are Zoom meeting videos as they have an option to download the mp4 file and the transcript with timestamps.
